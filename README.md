# Shining Suds
A digital laundromat service web app
## Prerequisites

Before running the Flask app, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Any version between 3.8 and 3.11 will work, 3.12 WILL NOT.
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) (Python package installer)

## Setup

1. **Setup repository:**
   - git clone https://github.com/Sulayman-ma/shining-suds.git
   - Navigate to the app root directory with cd shining-suds
2. **Virtual Environment**
  - (Recommended) The batch file in the root directory automatically creates a virtual environment, activates it, installs the required dependencies and runs the application
  - You can also choose to do this manually by inspecting the file and running the commands manually as required.
3. **Open your browser to [localhost port 5000](http://localhost:5000) and you're ready to go!**
